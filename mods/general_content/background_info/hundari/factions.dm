	description = "The Hundur Democratic Republic (HDR) is the name given to the planetary government that rose from the destruction of what is now called the Great War or War of Unathi Conquest.\
	The HDR is a Skrell Protectorate with significant but not-complete local governance, with a small Skrell presence due to its inhospitable climate of frozen glaciers, tundra, boreal forests, and dry grassland.\
	With centuries of Skrell leadership, few original aspects of Hundari culture are still practiced in their original forms as Hundari society began to imitate the trends and fashions of the prosperous Skrell society they were indebted to."
