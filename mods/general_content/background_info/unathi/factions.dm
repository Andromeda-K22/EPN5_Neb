	description = "Originating in the Cygnus arm of the galaxy came the Sha-Slin Khanate, a nomadic group of Unathi who left their desolate homeworld of Vaxl aboard advanced ships, roaming the galactic rim. Systems in the rim know of the Khnate mostly due to their raiding tendencies, \
	traveling in large fleets and establishing temporary tributary states among humans or other species such as the few remaining independent Hundari worlds. \
	Due to the Khanates incredibly loose government run by Sha-Slin clan members, all relating to one another, certain break away members have set up permanent Khanate star bases and colonized planets to act as a base of operation for future raids."
